...rusi se zeleni autobus tjeran jesenjim vjetrom, kao list niz jednu beogradsku padinu...

This is a school project, which focuses on design patterns rather than performance. So it was made under assumptions that client, server and database are all running on the same machine. Therefore, there are places in this code where service calls and database access are used to hotfix some issues, which in the real world conditions would represent bottle necks and it's performance would depend largely on network bandwidth and database size.

I have made decision to go with these hotfixes rather than optimal solutions in according to engineering practices, which opt for best solution under given circumstances minimizing resource usage.

Since time is the most valuable resource, I leave it be.
